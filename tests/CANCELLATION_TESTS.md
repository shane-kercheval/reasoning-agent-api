# Cancellation Test Architecture

This document explains the restructured cancellation test organization designed for maximum stability during the future ReasoningAgent → OrchestratorAgent refactor.

## Test Organization

### File Structure
```
tests/
├── unit_tests/
│   └── test_cancellation_api.py       # API layer unit tests
└── integration_tests/
    └── test_cancellation_api.py       # API layer integration tests
```

### Class Structure (4 Classes Total)

#### Unit Tests (`tests/unit_tests/test_cancellation_api.py`)

1. **`TestCancellationAPIEndpoint`** - ✅ **STABLE**
   - Tests FastAPI/HTTP layer cancellation behavior
   - Will survive agent refactoring (tests API, not agent details)
   - Focuses on: HTTP disconnection detection, streaming responses, multi-client isolation

2. **`TestCancellationAgentInterface`** - ✅ **PORTABLE** 
   - Tests agent cancellation interface contracts
   - Will work with any agent implementation (ReasoningAgent/OrchestratorAgent)
   - Focuses on: CancelledError propagation, resource cleanup, interface compliance

#### Integration Tests (`tests/integration_tests/test_cancellation_api.py`)

3. **`TestCancellationAPIIntegration`** - ✅ **STABLE**
   - Tests end-to-end API behavior with real components
   - Will survive agent refactoring (tests through API layer)
   - Focuses on: Real OpenAI cancellation through API, timing, multi-client with real processing

4. **`TestCancellationAgentIntegration`** - ✅ **PORTABLE**
   - Tests agent interface directly with real OpenAI calls
   - Will work with any future agent implementation
   - Focuses on: Direct agent cancellation, real connection cleanup, performance characteristics

## Stability Levels

### ✅ STABLE Tests (95% survival rate)
- Test through the FastAPI/HTTP layer (`chat_completions()` endpoint)
- Independent of agent implementation details
- Focus on API behavior, not agent internals

### ✅ PORTABLE Tests (90% survival rate)  
- Test agent interfaces, not implementation details
- Will work with ReasoningAgent, OrchestratorAgent, or any future agent
- Test contracts and behavior, not specific reasoning logic

### ❌ FRAGILE Tests (Avoided)
- Tests of ReasoningStep generation
- Tests of reasoning iteration logic
- Tests of reasoning-specific context management
- Tests of reasoning-specific event types

## Migration Strategy

When OrchestratorAgent replaces ReasoningAgent:

1. **Update fixtures** - Change `create_reasoning_agent()` to `create_orchestrator_agent()`
2. **Update imports** - `from api.orchestrator import OrchestratorAgent`  
3. **Tests continue working** - 95% should pass unchanged

### Example Migration

```python
# Before (tests/fixtures/agents.py)
def create_reasoning_agent(...):
    return ReasoningAgent(...)

# After  
def create_orchestrator_agent(...):
    return OrchestratorAgent(...)
```

## Test Coverage

All original cancellation test scenarios are preserved:
- ✅ Disconnection detection per chunk
- ✅ Early disconnection handling  
- ✅ Disconnection timing
- ✅ Non-streaming request isolation
- ✅ Concurrent request isolation
- ✅ OpenTelemetry span handling
- ✅ CancelledError propagation
- ✅ Real OpenAI call interruption
- ✅ Multi-client isolation with real processing
- ✅ Agent resource cleanup
- ✅ Direct agent cancellation

## Key Design Principles

1. **Test through stable interfaces** - API endpoints survive refactors
2. **Test contracts, not implementations** - Agent interfaces are portable
3. **Maximize test reuse** - Same tests work with different agents
4. **Clear stability indicators** - Each class documents its refactor resilience
5. **Comprehensive coverage** - All cancellation scenarios preserved

This architecture ensures that cancellation functionality remains thoroughly tested while minimizing test maintenance during major architectural changes.
