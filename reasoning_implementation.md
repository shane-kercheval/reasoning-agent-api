# Comprehensive Implementation Plan: MCP-Enabled Reasoning Agent API

## Project Overview

**Intent**: Transform the existing OpenAI-compatible proxy API into a reasoning agent that orchestrates multiple MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for parallel tool execution while maintaining full OpenAI API compatibility.

**Core Value**: Enable complex multi-step reasoning with parallel tool execution (e.g., "Compare Tokyo and NYC populations" ‚Üí parallel web searches ‚Üí synthesis) while providing rich progress tracking for clients.

## Architecture Components

### 1. ReasoningAgent (Primary Orchestrator)
**What**: Main class that replaces the current simple proxy logic in `api/reasoning_agent.py`

**Why**: Acts as the orchestrator coordinating OpenAI structured output reasoning, MCP tool execution, and response synthesis

**Must Do**:
- Accept OpenAI-compatible requests (both streaming and non-streaming)
- Load reasoning prompts from markdown files in `prompts/` directory
- Generate reasoning steps using OpenAI structured output with `ReasoningStep` Pydantic model
- Orchestrate parallel tool execution when `reasoning_step.parallel_execution = True`
- Stream progress with human-readable content plus structured `reasoning_event` metadata
- Handle MCP server/tool failures by streaming error events and continuing reasoning
- Return OpenAI-compatible responses

**Integration Point**: Replaces current `ReasoningAgent` class while maintaining existing FastAPI endpoint compatibility

**Documentation Requirement**: Comprehensive docstrings explaining orchestration flow, error handling strategy, and streaming format

### 2. MCPServerManager
**What**: New component managing MCP server connections AND tool execution

**Why**: Provides unified interface for both MCP server lifecycle management and tool execution, avoiding unnecessary complexity of separate components

**Must Do**:
- Load server configurations from YAML config file with environment variable authentication
- Support both stdio (local testing) and HTTP/SSE (remote production) transports
- Handle per-server authentication via environment variable references
- Gracefully handle server failures (continue with remaining available servers)
- Discover tools from successfully connected configured servers
- Execute single tools via MCP protocol
- Execute multiple tools in parallel across different servers using `asyncio.gather()`
- Handle tool execution failures gracefully with structured error responses

**Testing Requirement**: Comprehensive unit test coverage including connection failures, authentication errors, tool execution failures, and parallel execution scenarios

**Documentation Requirement**: Clear docstrings for all public methods explaining parameters, return values, error conditions, and usage examples

### 3. Enhanced Streaming with Reasoning Events
**What**: Extend OpenAI streaming format with structured reasoning metadata

**Why**: Provide rich progress tracking for smart clients while maintaining compatibility with standard OpenAI clients

**Implementation Detail**: Add `reasoning_event` field to delta objects containing structured metadata about reasoning progress, tool execution status, and step completion, e.g.

```
data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"content":"üîç **Step 1:** Analyzing the user's question...","reasoning_event":{"type":"reasoning_step","step_id":"1","tool_name":null,"status":"in_progress","metadata":{}}}}]}

data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"content":"üîß **Tools:** Executing web search for both cities","reasoning_event":{"type":"parallel_tools","step_id":"2","tools":["web_search:tokyo","web_search:nyc"],"status":"started"}}}]}

data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"content":"üìä **Result:** Tokyo: ~37.4M people","reasoning_event":{"type":"tool_result","step_id":"2a","tool_name":"web_search","status":"completed","result_data":{"population":"37400000","source":"official_data"}}}}]}
```

## Data Models

### Core Reasoning Models
```python
class ReasoningStep(BaseModel):
    thought: str
    next_action: ReasoningAction  # continue_thinking, use_tools, finished
    tools_to_use: List[ToolRequest] = []
    parallel_execution: bool = False

class ToolRequest(BaseModel):
    server_name: str  # Which MCP server
    tool_name: str
    reasoning: str  # Why this tool is needed

class ReasoningEvent(BaseModel):
    type: str  # "reasoning_step", "tool_execution", "tool_result", "synthesis"
    step_id: str
    tool_name: Optional[str] = None
    status: str  # "started", "in_progress", "completed", "failed"
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = {}
```

### Configuration Models
```python
class MCPServerConfig(BaseModel):
    name: str
    transport: str  # "stdio", "sse", "streamable_http"
    url: Optional[str] = None
    command: Optional[str] = None
    args: Optional[List[str]] = None
    auth_env_var: Optional[str] = None
```

## Prompt Management Strategy

### Prompt Organization
**What**: Store reasoning prompts in individual markdown files within `prompts/` directory

**Why**: Enables easy prompt iteration, version control, and separation of concerns between code logic and prompt engineering

**File Structure**:
- `prompts/reasoning_system.md` - System prompt for generating reasoning steps
- `prompts/final_answer.md` - System prompt for synthesizing final responses
- `prompts/tool_selection.md` - Guidance for tool selection and parallel execution decisions

**Implementation**: Load prompts at startup and inject into OpenAI structured output calls

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. MCP Integration Requirements
- **Use OpenAI Agents SDK** (not Responses API) for local/remote server flexibility
- **Support multiple concurrent MCP servers** for tool diversity
- **Handle both local (stdio) and remote (HTTP/SSE) servers** for testing/production flexibility
- **Implement proper authentication** using environment variable references in config
- **Graceful degradation** when MCP servers fail or are unavailable

### 2. Reasoning Requirements  
- **Use OpenAI structured output** (`response_format` parameter) for consistent reasoning step generation
- **Load prompts from markdown files** for maintainable prompt engineering
- **Support parallel tool execution** when reasoning determines tools can run concurrently
- **Continue reasoning after tool failures** by incorporating error information into reasoning context
- **Maintain reasoning context** across multiple iterations until completion

### 3. Streaming Requirements
- **Maintain OpenAI API compatibility** for existing clients
- **Provide structured metadata** via `reasoning_event` field for enhanced clients
- **Stream reasoning progress** in real-time as steps execute
- **Show parallel tool execution** progress with clear step identification
- **Human-readable fallback** for standard OpenAI clients

### 4. Configuration Requirements
- **YAML configuration file** for MCP server definitions
- **Environment variable authentication** for secure token management
- **Runtime server discovery** from configured servers only
- **Deployment-friendly** configuration suitable for Render platform

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Requirements
**MCPServerManager Testing Priority**: Comprehensive test coverage including:
- Server connection establishment (stdio, SSE, streamable HTTP)
- Authentication handling with environment variables
- Connection failure scenarios and recovery
- Tool discovery from multiple servers
- Single tool execution with success/failure cases
- Parallel tool execution across multiple servers
- Server unavailability and graceful degradation
- Tool execution timeout and error handling

**ReasoningAgent Testing**: 
- Prompt loading and injection
- OpenAI structured output parsing
- Streaming with reasoning events
- Error propagation and handling
- OpenAI API compatibility

### Local Development Testing
**Setup**: Use stdio MCP servers for immediate testing without external dependencies

**Test Cases**:
- No MCP servers configured (reasoning without tools)
- Single MCP server with multiple tools
- Multiple MCP servers with overlapping tool capabilities
- Parallel tool execution across different servers
- Server failure scenarios
- Tool execution failures

### Production Validation  
**Setup**: Remote MCP servers with proper authentication

**Focus**: Authentication, network reliability, performance under load

## Error Handling Strategy

### MCP Server Failures
**Intent**: Continue reasoning with available tools when some servers fail

**Approach**: 
- Stream error events to client for transparency
- Update available tool list dynamically
- Allow reasoning agent to adapt to missing tools
- Maintain service availability even with partial tool failure

### Tool Execution Failures
**Intent**: Provide error context to reasoning agent for adaptive decision-making

**Approach**:
- Stream tool failure events with error details
- Include error information in reasoning context
- Let reasoning agent decide whether to retry, use alternative tools, or continue without
