    Represents a specific tool that should be executed as part of a reasoning step.

    Use this when you need to call external tools to gather information, perform
    calculations, or take actions. Each tool prediction should have clear reasoning
    for why that specific tool is needed at this point in the reasoning process.

    We use JSON mode instead of OpenAI structured outputs or function calling because:

    1. **Architecture Requirements**: Our reasoning agent needs to predict reasoning steps
       AND tools in one response. OpenAI function calling assumes simple request -> tool
       execution, but we need multi-step reasoning planning.

    2. **Flexible Tool Arguments**: We need dict[str, Any] to work with any tool (MCP,
       function-based) at runtime. OpenAI structured outputs requires
       additionalProperties: false, which conflicts with flexible dictionaries.

    3. **Tool Agnostic Design**: We want to work with any tool signature without
       pre-defining all possible argument schemas. JSON mode gives us this flexibility.

    4. **Multi-Step Planning**: We want sophisticated reasoning about tool selection
       and sequencing, not just direct tool execution.
