| Building Block                | Endpoint                            | Description + Example                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Service-to-Service Invocation | `/v1.0/invoke`                       | Enables synchronous method calls between services (HTTP/gRPC) with service discovery, retries, and tracing.<br><br>**Example:** `POST /v1.0/invoke/service-b/method/api/orders` routes to Service B to fetch order details. |
| Publish & Subscribe (Pub/Sub) | `/v1.0/publish` / `/v1.0/subscribe` | Provides asynchronous, event-based messaging: publishers send to a topic, subscribers consume from it.<br><br>**Example:** `POST /v1.0/publish/pubsub/order-paid` to publish an “order-paid” event; a shipping service subscribed to that topic will act on it. |
| Workflows                      | `/v1.0/workflow`                    | Orchestrates long-running business processes across multiple microservices combining other building blocks.<br><br>**Example:** A checkout workflow might reserve inventory, charge payment, create shipment, and notify the user. |
| State Management               | `/v1.0/state`                       | Key/value store abstraction to persist application state across operations, with support for concurrency and consistency.<br><br>**Example:** `POST /v1.0/state/statestore` with `[{ "key": "cart123", "value": { "item": "Book", "quantity": 2 } }]` |
| Bindings                       | `/v1.0/bindings`                    | Interfaces your application with external systems (e.g. queues, databases, event sources), either via outgoing calls or by receiving triggers.<br><br>**Example:** `POST /v1.0/bindings/messagequeue` with `{ "operation": "create", "data": { "message": "Hello" } }` to send a message to a queue. |
| Actors                         | `/v1.0/actors`                      | Implements the virtual actor model: isolated, single-threaded units each carrying its own state and behavior.<br><br>**Example:** `POST /v1.0/actors/DeviceActor/device123/method/UpdateStatus` to invoke a method on a specific actor instance. |
| Secrets                        | `/v1.0/secrets`                     | Securely retrieves secrets (e.g. connection strings) from an external secret store.<br><br>**Example:** `GET /v1.0/secrets/mySecretStore/dbPassword` to fetch a database password. |
| Configuration                  | `/v1.0/configuration`               | Gets configuration values from a store and can subscribe to changes.<br><br>**Example:** `GET /v1.0/configuration/appconfig?key=featureFlagX` |
| Distributed Lock               | `/v1.0-alpha1/lock`                 | Lets you acquire a lock on a resource so concurrent instances coordinate safely.<br><br>**Example:** `POST /v1.0-alpha1/lock/mylockstore/acquire` with `{ "resourceId": "order-123", "lockOwner": "instance-1", "expiryInSeconds": 30 }` |
| Cryptography                   | `/v1.0-alpha1/crypto`               | Performs cryptographic operations (e.g. encrypt, decrypt, sign) without exposing raw keys to your app.<br><br>**Example:** `POST /v1.0-alpha1/crypto/encrypt` with `{ "plaintext": "mydata", "componentName": "cryptoStore" }` |
| Jobs                           | `/v1.0-alpha1/jobs`                 | Handles scheduling and orchestration of background or recurring tasks (cron-like jobs).<br><br>**Example:** `POST /v1.0-alpha1/jobs` with `{ "name": "dailyCleanup", "schedule": "0 0 * * *", "payload": { "task": "cleanup-temp-data" } }` |
| Conversation                    | `/v1.0-alpha1/conversation`          | Interfaces with large language models (LLMs) via prompts, with support for caching and PII redaction.<br><br>**Example:** `POST /v1.0-alpha1/conversation` with `{ "prompt": "Summarize customer feedback", "model": "gpt-4" }` |
